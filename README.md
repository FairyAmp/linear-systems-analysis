# linear-systems-analysis
ODE linear systems with plots and phase portraits.

This project provides a tool to analyze 2D linear systems of differential equations. It compares numerical solutions from 'odeint' with the exact solutions generated by matrix exponential.

## Note:
This is a personal educational project, created to test out Python visualization of linear dynamics. The code is a work in progress. Eventually, I plan to refine the structure and add more features. Since this repository is a sandboc for my ODE solver experiments, the code may not be fully optimized. I may make frequent changes as I go.

## Mathematical Overview
The system is defined by:
$$\mathbf{\dot{x}} = A\mathbf{x}$$

The behavior of the trajectories is determined by the **trace** and **determinant** of the matrix $A$.

## Features
* **Phase Portraits** Plots vector fields and steamlines.
* * **Interactive Visualization:** Uses `ipywidgets` to change matrix parameters on the fly.
